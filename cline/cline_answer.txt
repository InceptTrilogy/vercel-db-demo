The issue you're experiencing stems from a mismatch between the route definitions in your FastAPI application and how Vercel handles serverless functions and routing.

### **Understanding the Problem**

1. **Route Prefixing**: When you deploy to Vercel, it automatically serves your serverless functions under the `/api` path. So, when you define your endpoint in FastAPI as `"/api/health"`, and Vercel maps it under `/api`, the actual path becomes `/api/api/health`, which is not intended.

2. **Vercel's Routing**: The `routes` field in your `vercel.json` is redirecting all `/api/*` paths to `api/index.py`. This may interfere with the default routing behavior and cause unexpected path mappings.

### **Solution**

**1. Remove the `/api` Prefix from Your Endpoint**

Modify your FastAPI endpoint to remove the `/api` prefix:

```python
# In api/index.py

@app.get("/health", response_model=HealthResponse)
async def health() -> HealthResponse:
    return HealthResponse(
        status="healthy",
        version="0.1.0"
    )
```

**Explanation**: Since Vercel serves your function under `/api` by default, your FastAPI app should define routes relative to that path. By setting your endpoint to `"/health"`, it will be accessible at `https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app/api/health`.

**2. Simplify Your `vercel.json` Configuration**

Update your `vercel.json` to remove unnecessary fields:

```json
{
    "version": 2,
    "builds": [
        {
            "src": "api/index.py",
            "use": "@vercel/python"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Explanation**: Vercel automatically handles routing for serverless functions in the `api` directory. By removing the `routes` field, you allow Vercel to use its default routing logic, which maps requests to the corresponding serverless functions.

**3. Ensure Proper Import and Application Instantiation**

Make sure your FastAPI app is properly instantiated and that the file exports the `app` object:

```python
# In api/index.py

from fastapi import FastAPI
from models import HealthResponse  # Ensure this import is correct

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/health", response_model=HealthResponse)
async def health() -> HealthResponse:
    return HealthResponse(
        status="healthy",
        version="0.1.0"
    )
```

**4. Verify Your `requirements.txt`**

Ensure all necessary dependencies are listed in your `requirements.txt` file, including `fastapi` and `pydantic`:

```
fastapi
uvicorn
pydantic
```

**5. Redeploy Your Application**

After making these changes, redeploy your application to Vercel:

```bash
vercel --prod
```

**6. Test the Endpoint**

Access your health check endpoint:

```
https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app/api/health
```

### **Why This Works**

- **Alignment with Vercel's Defaults**: By adjusting your endpoint and configuration, you align your application with Vercel's default behavior, reducing complexity and potential misconfigurations.

- **Simplified Routing**: Removing the custom `routes` configuration avoids unintended path remappings that can lead to 404 errors.

### **Additional Tips**

- **Check Logs**: Use Vercel's logging to check for any runtime errors that might not be apparent from the 404 response.

- **Documentation Reference**: For more details, refer to Vercel's official documentation on deploying Python serverless functions.

### **Summary**

The 404 error occurs because the endpoint paths in your FastAPI app do not align with how Vercel routes requests to your serverless functions. By removing the `/api` prefix from your endpoint definitions and simplifying your `vercel.json`, you allow Vercel to correctly map incoming requests to your FastAPI app, resolving the issue.
